its for forge 1.20.1, and you need TerraFirmaCraft, FirmaLife, KubeJS, Pollution of the Realms, and Advanced Chimneys

# features
right clicking a filter with an empty hand should report how much pollution it has collected (if any)

reed filter: only absorbs carbon, but absorbs it twice as fast as a charcoal filter. it can only hold 4 charges max per block, and it doesn't give any resources. it is flammable, and doesnt drop itself when broken so it cant be easily replaced. this is meant to be a very early game way to deal with carbon, which is the majority of pollution

charcoal filter: absorbs carbon and dust, and can also be brushed clean for soot. it can hold 8 charges per block

limewater filter: only absorbs sulfur, and can also be right clicked with a tfc compatible fluid container with vinegar inside to extract sulfur powder. it can also be brushed clean, but it wont give any resources. it can hold 8 charges per block

chromium filter: absorbs all 3 forms of pollution. can be brushed for soot, or right clicked with a fluid container with vinegar to get sulfur powder. it can hold 16 charges per block between both pollution types added up
